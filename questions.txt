rails new

change password in ynl

rake db:create

put in password; change localhost to 127.0.0.1

rails generate controller home index
  or welcome or whatever

create model file

what does attr_accessible do?


what does the test folder do - is this truly for testing scenarios??

resources in route - does that point to the main app file?
