    <CategoryName>Adware (General)</CategoryName>
    <CategoryDescription>Adware, also known as advertising software, displays third-party advertising on the computer. The ads can take several forms, including pop-ups, pop-unders, banners, or links embedded within web pages or parts of the Windows interface. Some adware advertising might consists of text ads shown within the application itself or within side bars, search bars, and search results. Adware is often contextually or behaviorally based and tracks browsing habits in order to display ads that are meant to be relevant to the user.</CategoryDescription>

    <CategoryDescription>An Adware Bundler is a downloadable program that is typically "freeware" because it is bundled with advertising software -- adware. The adware may function independently of the bundler program, but in some cases the bundler program will not function if the adware is removed, or will not install unless the adware is installed. Most Adware Bundlers install several adware applications from multiple adware vendors, each of which is governed by a separate End User License Agreement (EULA) and Privacy Policy. Some Adware Bundlers may not fully and properly disclose the presence of bundled advertising software during installation.</CategoryDescription>

The logged data, which may be encrypted, is saved or sent to the person who installed the key logger. These applications often run in stealth mode and are invisible to the user that is being monitored. Such key loggers are sold commercially and may be used legitimately if deployed by authorized administrators and disclosed to the persons being monitored, as in a business environment. The use of a key logger to monitor persons without their knowledge has been ruled illegal in at least one jurisdiction.</CategoryDescription>

    <CategoryDescription>Hijackers are software programs that modify users' default browser home page, search settings, error page settings, or desktop wallpaper without adequate notice, disclosure, or user consent. When the default home page is hijacked, the browser opens to the web page set by the hijacker instead of the user's designated home page. In some cases, the hijacker may block users from restoring their desired home page. A search hijacker redirects search results to other pages and may transmit search and browsing data to unknown servers. An error page hijacker directs the browser to another page, usually an advertising page, instead of the usual error page when the requested URL is not found. A desktop hijacker replaces the desktop wallpaper with advertising for products and services on the desktop.</CategoryDescription>

    <CategoryDescription>A Virus is a piece of malicious code that has the ability to replicate itself and invade other programs or files in order to spread within the infected machine. Viruses typically spread when users execute infected files or load infected media, especially removable media such as floppy disks or CD-ROMs. Viruses can also spread via email through infected attachments and files. Most Viruses include a "payload" of some sort. Some "payloads" are merely annoying and disruptive; other "payloads" may damage software and data on a computer or even the computer hardware itself.</CategoryDescription>

    <CategoryDescription>A Worm is a malicious program that spreads itself without any user intervention. Worms are similar to viruses in that they self-replicate. Unlike viruses, however, worms spread without attaching to or infecting other programs and files. A Worm can spread across computer networks via security holes on vulnerable machines connected to the network. Worms can also spread through email by sending copies of itself to everyone in the user's address book. A Worm may consume a large amount of system resources and cause the machine to become noticeably sluggish and unreliable. Some Worms may be used to compromise infected machines and download additional malicious software.</CategoryDescription>

    <CategoryDescription>Zombies and Bots are programs used to compromise a computer and allow it to be remotely exploited by an attacker for specific malicious tasks. A computer infected with a Zombie or Bot may be used by an attacker to send spam, participate in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack against web sites or other computers, or install adware and spyware for monetary gain. The "zombied" or compromised computer becomes part of a Botnet -- a large network of other compromised machines that are controlled and used for malicious purposes by the Bot master.</CategoryDescription>
