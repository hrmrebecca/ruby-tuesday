delete contents of gemfile.lock in the actual project directory
gem install bundler


1) create new repository

2) git init  - initialize an empty git repository in local project

3) git add .  - i think this copies all the files from the local project to the repository

4) git commit -m "Initial Commit"  - commit changes?

5) git remote add origin https://github.com/hrmrebecca/railsinstaller_demo.git  - push changes to the server

6) git push origin master  - this pushes the code, duh. don't remember what preve command does

7) publickey	- if you get an error with the push, type this at the command line, then
                  copy whatever it gives you
		go to github and account settings and find SSH Public Keys and create a new public key, and then
                 paste the key that you generated
*when I used the push command, i just had to sign in w/my github account
